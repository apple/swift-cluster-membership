# ``SWIM``

This library aims to help Swift make ground in a new space: clustered multi-node distributed systems.

## Overview

With this library we provide reusable runtime agnostic membership protocol implementations which can be adopted in various clustering use-cases.

## Background

Cluster membership protocols are a crucial building block for distributed systems, such as computation intensive clusters, schedulers, databases, key-value stores and more. With the announcement of this package, we aim to make building such systems simpler, as they no longer need to rely on external services to handle service membership for them. We would also like to invite the community to collaborate on and develop additional membership protocols.

At their core, membership protocols need to provide an answer for the question "Who are my (live) peers?". This seemingly simple task turns out to be not so simple at all in a distributed system where delayed or lost messages, network partitions, and unresponsive but still "alive" nodes are the daily bread and butter. Providing a predictable, reliable answer to this question is what cluster membership protocols do.

There are various trade-offs one can take while implementing a membership protocol, and it continues to be an interesting area of research and continued refinement. As such, the cluster-membership package intends to focus not on a single implementation, but serve as a collaboration space for various distributed algorithms in this space.

### High-level Protocol Description

> For a more in-depth discussion of the protocol and modifications in this implementation we suggest reading the [SWIM API Documentation](https://apple.github.io/swift-cluster-membership/docs/current/SWIM/Enums/SWIM.html), as well as the associated papers linked below.

The [*Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style process group Membership*](https://research.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf) algorithm (also known as "SWIM"), along with a few notable protocol extensions as documented in the 2018 [*Lifeguard: Local Health Awareness for More Accurate Failure Detection*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00788) paper.

SWIM is a [gossip protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol) in which peers periodically exchange bits of information about their observations of other nodes‚Äô statuses, eventually spreading the information to all other members in a cluster. This category of distributed algorithms are very resilient against arbitrary message loss, network partitions and similar issues.

At a high level, SWIM works like this:

* A member periodically pings a "randomly" selected peer it is aware of. It does so by sending a `.ping` message to that peer, expecting an [`.ack`](https://apple.github.io/swift-cluster-membership/docs/current/SWIM/Protocols/SWIMPingOriginPeer.html#/s:4SWIM18SWIMPingOriginPeerP3ack13acknowledging6target11incarnation7payloadys6UInt32V_AA8SWIMPeer_ps6UInt64VA2AO13GossipPayloadOtF) to be sent back. See how `A` probes `B` initially in the diagram below.
    * The exchanged messages also carry a gossip `payload`, which is (partial) information about what other peers the sender of the message is aware of, along with their membership status (`.alive`, `.suspect`, etc.)
* If it receives an `.ack`, the peer is considered still `.alive`. Otherwise, the target peer might have terminated/crashed or is unresponsive for other reasons.
    * In order to double-check if the peer really is dead, the origin asks a few other peers about the state of the unresponsive peer by sending `.pingRequest` messages to a configured number of other peers, which then issue direct pings to that peer (probing peer E in the diagram below).
* If those pings fail, due to lack of `.ack`s resulting in the peer being marked as `.suspect`,
    * Our protocol implementation will also use additional `.nack` ("negative acknowledgement") messages in the situation to inform the ping request origin that the intermediary did receive those `.pingRequest` messages, however the target seems to not have responded. We use this information to adjust a Local Health Multiplier, which affects how timeouts are calculated. To learn more about this refer to the API docs and the Lifeguard paper.

The above mechanism serves not only as a failure detection mechanism, but also as a gossip mechanism, which carries information about known members of the cluster. This way members eventually learn about the status of their peers, even without having them all listed upfront. It is worth pointing out however that this membership view is [weakly-consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_consistency), which means there is no guarantee (or way to know, without additional information) if all members have the same exact view on the membership at any given point in time. However, it is an excellent building block for higher-level tools and systems to build their stronger guarantees on top.

Once the failure detection mechanism detects an unresponsive node, it eventually is marked as `.dead` resulting in its irrevocable removal from the cluster. Our implementation offers an optional extension, adding an `.unreachable` state to the possible states, however most users will not find it necessary and it is disabled by default. For details and rules about legal status transitions refer to [SWIM.Status](https://github.com/apple/swift-cluster-membership/blob/main/Sources/SWIM/Status.swift#L18-L39) or the following diagram:

The way Swift Cluster Membership implements protocols is by offering "`Instances`" of them. For example, the SWIM implementation is encapsulated in the runtime agnostic [`SWIM.Instance`](https://github.com/apple/swift-cluster-membership/blob/main/Sources/SWIM/SWIMInstance.swift) which needs to be ‚Äúdriven‚Äù or ‚Äúinterpreted‚Äù by some glue code between a networking runtime and the instance itself. We call those glue pieces of an implementation "`Shell`s", and the library ships with a `SWIMNIOShell` implemented using [SwiftNIO](https://www.github.com/apple/swift-nio)‚Äôs `DatagramChannel` that performs all messaging asynchronously over [UDP](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/UDP-User-Datagram-Protocol). Alternative implementations can use completely different transports, or piggy back SWIM messages on some other existing gossip system etc.

The SWIM instance also has built-in support for emitting metrics (using [swift-metrics](https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics)) and can be configured to log details about internal details by passing a [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) `Logger`.

### Example: Reusing the SWIM protocol logic implementation

The primary purpose of this library is to share the `SWIM.Instance` implementation across various implementations which need some form of in-process membership service. Implementing a custom runtime is documented in depth in the project‚Äôs README (https://github.com/apple/swift-cluster-membership/), so please have a look there if you are interested in implementing SWIM over some different transport.

Implementing a new transport boils down a ‚Äúfill in the blanks‚Äù exercise:

First, one has to implement the Peer protocols (https://github.com/apple/swift-cluster-membership/blob/main/Sources/SWIM/Peer.swift) using one‚Äôs target transport:

```swift
/// SWIM peer which can be initiated contact with, by sending ping or ping request messages.
public protocol SWIMPeer: SWIMAddressablePeer {
    /// Perform a probe of this peer by sending a `ping` message.
    /// 
    /// <... more docs here - please refer to the API docs for the latest version ...>
    func ping(
        payload: SWIM.GossipPayload,
        from origin: SWIMPingOriginPeer,
        timeout: DispatchTimeInterval,
        sequenceNumber: SWIM.SequenceNumber
    ) async throws -> SWIM.PingResponse
    
    // ... 
}
```

Which usually means wrapping some connection, channel, or other identity with the ability to send messages and invoke the appropriate callbacks when applicable.

Then, on the receiving end of a peer, one has to implement receiving those messages and invoke all the corresponding 
`on<SomeMessage>(...)` callbacks defined on the ``SWIM/Instance`` (grouped under ``SWIMProtocol``).

A piece of the ``SWIMProtocol`` is listed below to give you an idea about it:


```swift
public protocol SWIMProtocol {

    /// MUST be invoked periodically, in intervals of `self.swim.dynamicLHMProtocolInterval`.
    ///
    /// MUST NOT be scheduled using a "repeated" task/timer", as the interval is dynamic and may change as the algorithm proceeds.
    /// Implementations should schedule each next tick by handling the returned directive's `scheduleNextTick` case,
    /// which includes the appropriate delay to use for the next protocol tick.
    ///
    /// This is the heart of the protocol, as each tick corresponds to a "protocol period" in which:
    /// - suspect members are checked if they're overdue and should become `.unreachable` or `.dead`,
    /// - decisions are made to `.ping` a random peer for fault detection,
    /// - and some internal house keeping is performed.
    ///
    /// Note: This means that effectively all decisions are made in interval sof protocol periods.
    /// It would be possible to have a secondary periodic or more ad-hoc interval to speed up
    /// some operations, however this is currently not implemented and the protocol follows the fairly
    /// standard mode of simply carrying payloads in periodic ping messages.
    ///
    /// - Returns: `SWIM.Instance.PeriodicPingTickDirective` which must be interpreted by a shell implementation
    mutating func onPeriodicPingTick() -> [SWIM.Instance.PeriodicPingTickDirective]

    mutating func onPing( ... ) -> [SWIM.Instance.PingDirective]

    mutating func onPingRequest( ... ) -> [SWIM.Instance.PingRequestDirective]

    mutating func onPingResponse( ... ) -> [SWIM.Instance.PingResponseDirective]

    // ... 
}
```

These calls perform all SWIM protocol specific tasks internally, and return directives which are simple to interpret ‚Äúcommands‚Äù to an implementation about how it should react to the message. For example, upon receiving a `.pingRequest` message, the returned directive may instruct a shell to send a ping to some nodes. The directive prepares all apropriate target, timeout and additional information that makes it simpler to simply follow its instruction and implement the call correctly, e.g. like this:

```swift
self.swim.onPingRequest(
    target: target,
    pingRequestOrigin: pingRequestOrigin,            
    payload: payload,
    sequenceNumber: sequenceNumber
).forEach { directive in
    switch directive {
    case .gossipProcessed(let gossipDirective):
        self.handleGossipPayloadProcessedDirective(gossipDirective)

    case .sendPing(let target, let payload, let pingRequestOriginPeer, let pingRequestSequenceNumber, let timeout, let sequenceNumber):
        self.sendPing(
            to: target,
            payload: payload,
            pingRequestOrigin: pingRequestOriginPeer,
            pingRequestSequenceNumber: pingRequestSequenceNumber,
            timeout: timeout,
            sequenceNumber: sequenceNumber
        )
    }
}
```

In general this allows for all the tricky "what to do when" to be encapsulated within the protocol instance, and a Shell only has to follow instructions implementing them. The actual implementations will often need to perform some more involved concurrency and networking tasks, like awaiting a sequence of responses, and handling them in a specific way etc, however the general outline of the protocol is orchestrated by the instance's directives.
