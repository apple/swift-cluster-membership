/// ## Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Process Group Membership Protocol
///
/// > As you swim lazily through the milieu, <br/>
/// > The secrets of the world will infect you.
///
/// Implementation of the SWIM protocol in abstract terms, not dependent on any specific runtime.
/// The actual implementation resides in `SWIM.Instance`.
///
/// ### Terminology
/// This implementation follows the original terminology mostly directly, with the notable exception of the original
/// wording of "confirm" being rather represented as `SWIM.Status.dead`, as we found the "confirm" wording to be
/// confusing in practice.
///
/// ### Extensions & Modifications
///
/// This implementation has a few notable extensions and modifications implemented, some documented already in the initial
/// SWIM paper, some in the Lifeguard extensions paper and some being simple adjustments we found practical in our environments.
///
/// - The "random peer selection" is not completely ad-hoc random, but follows a _stable order_, randomized on peer insertion.
///   - Unlike the completely random selection in the original paper. This has the benefit of consistently going "around"
///     all peers participating in the cluster, enabling a more efficient spread of membership information among peers,
///     by allowing us to avoid continuously (yet randomly) selecting the same few peers.
///   - This optimization is described in the original SWIM paper, and followed by some implementations.
///
/// - Introduction of an `.unreachable` status, that is ordered after `.suspect` and before `.dead`.
///   - This is because the decision to move an unreachable peer to .dead status is a large and important decision,
///     in which user code may want to participate, e.g. by attempting "shoot the other peer in the head" or other patterns,
///     before triggering the `.dead` status (which usually implies a complete removal of information of that peer existence from the cluster),
///     after which no further communication with given peer will ever be possible anymore.
///   - The `.unreachable` status is optional and _disabled_ by default.
///   - Other SWIM implementations handle this problem by _storing_ dead members for a period of time after declaring them dead,
///     also deviating from the original paper; so we conclude that this use case is quite common and allow addressing it in various ways.
///
/// - Preservation of `.unreachable` information
///   - The original paper does not keep in memory information about dead peers,
///     it only gossips the information that a member is now dead, but does not keep tombstones for later reference.
///
/// Implementations of extensions documented in the Lifeguard paper (linked below):
///
/// - Local Health Aware Probe - which replaces the static timeouts in probing with a dynamic one, taking into account
///   recent communication failures of our member with others.
/// - Local Health Aware Suspicion - which improves the way `.suspect` states and their timeouts are handled,
///   effectively relying on more information about unreachability. See: `suspicionTimeout`.
/// - Buddy System - enables members to directly and immediately notify suspect peers about them being suspected,
///   such that they have more time and a chance to refute these suspicions more quickly, rather than relying on completely
///   random gossip for that suspicion information to reach such suspect peer.
///
/// SWIM serves as a low-level distributed failure detector mechanism.
/// It also maintains its own membership in order to monitor and select peers to ping with periodic health checks,
/// however this membership is not directly the same as the high-level membership exposed by the `Cluster`.
///
/// ### SWIM Membership
/// SWIM provides a weakly consistent view on the process group membership.
/// Membership in this context means that we have some knowledge about the node, that was acquired by either
/// communicating with the peer directly, for example when initially connecting to the cluster,
/// or because some other peer shared information about it with us.
/// To avoid moving a peer "back" into alive or suspect state because of older statuses that get replicated,
/// we need to be able to put them into temporal order. For this reason each peer has an incarnation number assigned to it.
///
/// This number is monotonically increasing and can only be incremented by the respective peer itself and only if it is
/// suspected by another peer in its current incarnation.
///
/// The ordering of statuses is as follows:
///
///     alive(N) < suspect(N) < alive(N+1) < suspect(N+1) < dead
///
/// A member that has been declared dead can *never* return from that status and has to be restarted to join the cluster.
/// Note that such "restarted node" from SWIM's perspective is simply a new node which happens to occupy the same host/port,
/// as nodes are identified by their unique identifiers (`ClusterMembership.Node.uid`).
///
/// The information about dead nodes will be kept for a configurable amount of time, after which it will be removed to
/// prevent the state on each node from growing too big. The timeout value should be chosen to be big enough to prevent
/// faulty nodes from re-joining the cluster and is usually in the order of a few days.
///
/// ### SWIM Gossip
///
/// SWIM uses an infection style gossip mechanism to replicate state across the cluster.
/// The gossip payload contains information about other nodeâ€™s observed status, and will be disseminated throughout the
/// cluster by piggybacking onto periodic health check messages, i.e. whenever a node is sending a ping, a ping request,
/// or is responding with an acknowledgement, it will include the latest gossip with that message as well. When a node
/// receives gossip, it has to apply the statuses to its local state according to the ordering stated above. If a node
/// receives gossip about itself, it has to react accordingly.
///
/// If it is suspected by another peer in its current incarnation, it has to increment its incarnation in response.
/// If it has been marked as dead, it SHOULD shut itself down (i.e. terminate the entire node / service), to avoid "zombie"
/// nodes staying around even though they are already ejected from the cluster.
///
